# Main_NFT_contracts
Hi all! In this repository, I have developed a generic NFT contract to run the NFT collection. It has features such as:
- White list.
- Ability to premint for accounts in the white list.
- Ability to stop and turn on the possibility of mint.
- Ability to hide collection URI and enable it later.
- Possibility to declare the cost, the maximum amount of NFT for mint by one account.
As well as other functionality.
